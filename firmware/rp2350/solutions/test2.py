"""
A PIO is used to encode bits into short (12 cycles) and long (32 cycles) pulses on GPIO22. 
However, it is difficult to measure this with CPU-sampling due to its short durations (<1ms). 
Instead, we use another PIO available on the RP2040 to sniff this high-speed pulses, as the 
PIO block runs independently at 125MHz, allowing cycle-accurate pulse counting (8ns ticks).

For this example, we wire GPIO22 to GPIO24 and sample on GPIO24.

Each RP2040 PIO has only four 32-bit RX-FIFO entries. Without packing, capturing a 64-edge
(low -> high) burst would overflow the FIFO. To avoid this, we pack four 8-bit width counts into
one 32-bit FIFO word, then DMA the packed data into RAM. After transmission, we unpack,
convert loop counts to microseconds, apply a threshold, and reconstruct the ASCII flag.
